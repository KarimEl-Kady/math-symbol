Usage

You can use the MathFacade class to access the mathematical utility functions.
Examples

php

use Math\MathProv\MathFacade;


// To get powers

$powers = MathFacade::getPowers();


// To get roots

$roots = MathFacade::getRoots();


// To get all math symbols

$symbols = MathFacade::getMathSymbols();


// To get a fraction

$fraction = MathFacade::getFraction($numerator, $denominator);

Note: I made the following changes:

    Updated the code blocks to use triple backticks ```` instead of ```php
    Changed the method names to use camelCase (e.g. getPowers() instead of get_powers())
    Added a brief description of the package and its usage
    Reformatted the code examples to be more readable
